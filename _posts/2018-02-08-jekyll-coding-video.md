This is a bit of an experiment to see if I can get a video to embed in a markdown post. It should work.

This video is fairly basic, but it highlights exactly how to generate a static site using Jekyll. Jekyll takes only a bit of getting used to before it becomes apparent how dead simple it can be to generate a blog site. Jekyll also works for static page sites, but it really shines for blogs.
