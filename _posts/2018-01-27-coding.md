I have been learning to code for only a short while, but I have been developing a portfolio of projects as I go along. Here is a list of some of the better projects I have done so far. I will add to the list from time to time as I finish various projects.

* A [URL shortener/lengthener app](https://pulamusic.github.io/AJAXRequestPractice/index.html)
* A [Wikipedia Search Page](https://codepen.io/pulamusic/full/gmevav/) (on CodePen)
* A [weather &amp; travel app](https://pulamusic.github.io/weatherApp/)
* A [news streaming app](https://pulamusic.github.io/newsworthy/)
* A [dice rolling game](https://pulamusic.github.io/diceGame/)
* A [YouTube search app](https://pulamusic.github.io/youTubeSearch/)
* A [demo web page](https://pulamusic.github.io/travel-site/) with some cool but subtle JavaScript features
* A [simple budget app](https://pulamusic.github.io/budgety/) created from a Udemy.com JavaScript tutorial
